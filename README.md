#### Description:

### WHAT IS IT?
Made with Python, Flask, Flask-sqlalchemy, HTML, CSS, and Javascript, Trackr was created to provide a hassle-free way to track your finances with an easy to understand user interface. 

The website greets the user with a login page and allows the user to create an account if they haven't already. Once it authenticates a login/register it takes the user to the home page. There, the user can see their yearly income, expenses and the money they have left over. The user can report any income they earnt. After submitting an income they can see it appear on the chart and can add as many incomes as they want. The expenses page works very similarly but it takes care of how much the user spent in a certain month.
